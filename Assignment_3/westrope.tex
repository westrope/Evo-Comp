\section{Report}
 This homework's goal was to impliment a K-SAT solver that uses a generaltional genetic algorithm. The results were that my program would find a solution but it doesn't find all solutions. So running the program on the same K-SAT probem can yield different solutions, but they will be correct solutions.
