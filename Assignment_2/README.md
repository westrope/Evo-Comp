# Assignment Two

In this assignment the goal is to use simulated anealing to find one of the local maximum in the given function. The function has a few hundred small peaks and less then five tall peaks. These tall peaks are our goal.

The x and y coordinates will be stored as doubles. The mutations will be a random double added to these. The random number will come from a normal, cauchy, or uniform distribution. Other variables such as starting temperature and cooling constant will be given on the command line.
