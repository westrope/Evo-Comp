\section{Report}
In this homework we were to break a simple substitution cipher. I found that I spent most of my time in the fitness function with cross over and mutation being fairly simple. Currently my fitness function is broken in that it isn't giving me a proper fitness and that it is super slow with some programs taking minutes to run.
