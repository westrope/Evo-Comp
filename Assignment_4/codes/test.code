CLEAR:
The blacksmith shop was a great place to visit. The
blacksmith wore a heavy leather apron, usually split down
the middle so he could hold a horse's leg between his legs
while he was nailing the shoe on the horse's foot. The
central point of the shop was a forge, an open fire pit
with bellows attached underneath. To sharpen plow shares,
he would use the bellows to blow up a hot fire with the
shares in it. When the shares were red-hot, he would pound
on them on the anvil with a heavy hammer. In this manner
the blacksmith was able to flatten the cutting edge of the
plow share until it was fairly sharp. By the same process
the blacksmith fashioned or repaired various metal parts
for wagons, plows and other farm equipment. It was quite a
treat to watch the metal take on a bright glow and then
see the sparks flying every which way as he pounded on it.
Two things in the medical office always intrigued me --
the microscope and the centrifuge. Father would let me
look at common small objects under the microscope and to
my wonderment they would be greatly magnified. The
centrifuge was powered by a hand crank and would spin two
cups about the shape of test tubes on each side to
separate materials of different density. I don't know
exactly the purpose of this procedure, but perhaps it was
to test the patient's blood.
